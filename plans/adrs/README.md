# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains durable decisions that affect snip-it architecture
across milestones or subsystems.

Use an ADR when a question cannot be answered safely inside one
implementation plan without establishing a reusable architectural contract.

## Naming

```text
ADR-NNNN-short-title.md
```

Numbers are monotonically increasing and never reused.

## Status lifecycle

```text
proposed -> accepted -> deprecated or superseded
         `-> rejected
```

Accepted ADRs are historical records. Do not rewrite an accepted ADR to
make a later decision appear original. Create a new ADR and mark the old
one superseded.

## ADR template

```markdown

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Decision owners: project maintainers

## Context

Describe the architectural problem, existing implementation, constraints,
and why the decision is required now.

## Decision drivers

- ...

## Considered options

### Option A — Name

Description, benefits, costs, and failure modes.

### Option B — Name

Description, benefits, costs, and failure modes.

## Decision

State the selected option precisely, including ownership and interface
boundaries.

## Consequences

### Positive

- ...

### Negative

- ...

### Neutral or deferred

- ...

## Compatibility and migration

Describe storage, protocol, configuration, API, and operational migration
requirements.

## Security and reliability implications

Describe authorization, secret handling, contention, cancellation, restart,
recovery, and denial-of-service effects.

## Verification

Describe the evidence required to prove implementations conform to this
decision.

## Supersession

None.

## ADR threshold

An ADR is normally required when a decision:

- changes snippet/library identity, conflict, durability, or recovery
  semantics;
- introduces a new sync, MCP, HTTP, provider, or storage protocol;
- selects a durable external standard or dependency (eggfetch profile,
  EggServe runtime, keyring, Argon2 parameters);
- changes CLI compatibility, exit-code, or machine-output contracts;
- changes sync or auto-sync authority, locking, or fencing semantics;
- changes release identity, publication, or installer trust policy;
- establishes a public compatibility contract;
- materially changes a long-term non-goal.

An ADR is usually unnecessary for local refactors, internal naming cleanup,
implementation-specific data structures, or reversible optimizations that
preserve established contracts.
