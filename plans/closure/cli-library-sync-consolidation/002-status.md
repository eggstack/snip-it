# Shared inspection and read-only library resolution — Closure Status

Status: closed

Source implementation plan:

- `plans/implementation/cli-library-sync-consolidation/002-shared-inspection-and-readonly-library-resolution.md`

Source subsystem roadmap:

- `plans/subsystems/cli-library-sync-consolidation-roadmap.md`

Pre-convention predecessor (history preserved via `git mv`):

- `plans/archive/flat-009-shared-inspection-and-readonly-library-resolution.md`

Repository baseline reviewed: pre-convention lineage (see implementation file); migration to this convention preserved history and did not change code.

Implementation commits or pull requests:

- Pre-convention implementation history; see the implementation file body and Git history for the subsystem path.

Primary class: infrastructure. Dependencies: hard M001.

## 1. Executive finding

M002 is closed. Side-effect-free shared library resolution plus narrowly shared inspection primitives exist; read paths use the readonly resolver and corrupt inputs fail closed.

## 2. Requirement-to-evidence matrix

| Requirement | Evidence | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Readonly resolver + inspect primitives adopted | Implementation file + archive pointer | pass | No writable synthesis on corrupt inputs. |

## 3. Production implementation evidence

Landed behavior is described in the source implementation file (body unchanged by the convention migration). This record distinguishes implemented behavior (per the finding above) from planned-but-absent behavior (none; the milestone is closed).

## 4. Verification executed

### Commands run

```bash
# Pre-convention milestone: exact per-run command logs predate the closure template.
# Authoritative gate for this repo:
bash scripts/check.sh
bash scripts/ci/test-production-seams.sh
```

### Results

Pre-convention milestone: evidence in the implementation file and archive pointer. No unresolved medium-or-higher finding remains.

## 5. Invariant review

Long-term invariants for this subsystem (see the subsystem roadmap §2) remain true per the implementation file and its referenced tests/guards. No invariant regression was introduced by the convention migration (planning-only change).

## 6. Failure and recovery review

Covered in the implementation file where applicable (idempotency, cancellation, restart, contention, malformed input, bounded transfers). No new failure mode introduced by the migration.

## 7. Migration and compatibility review

No code, schema, protocol, or compatibility change in the migration commit. User-facing contracts unchanged; historical releases untouched.

## 8. Security review

No credential, secret-handling, or authorization change in the migration. Subsystem security properties are those recorded in the implementation file.

## 9. Documentation and operations

Planning documentation updated to the codegg convention in the migration commit (canonical docs, READMEs, subsystem roadmaps, registry, `plans/README.md`, `AGENTS.md` pointer, planning skill). Operational docs are those referenced by the implementation file.

## 10. Unresolved findings

| Severity | Finding | Impact | Required action |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | none | — | — |

## 11. Roadmap disposition

Milestone closed and next dependency may proceed (all dependencies in this subsystem are closed; see the subsystem roadmap §12 and `plans/registry.md`).

## 12. Registry updates

Recorded in `plans/registry.md` (recently closed work) and the subsystem roadmap milestone-status table by the migration commit.
